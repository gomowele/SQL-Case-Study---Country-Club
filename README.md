# Country Club SQL Case Study (Tier 2)

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹  
This is my submission for the Springboard SQL mini project (Tier 2). It covers SQL queries using both MySQL (via PHPMyAdmin) and SQLite (via Jupyter Notebook with Python).

## Whatâ€™s Inside

- `sqltasks_tier2.sql`: My answers to Part 1 (Questions 1â€“9), written and tested using PHPMyAdmin.
- `CountryClub_Part2.ipynb`: My notebook for Part 2 (Questions 10â€“13), where I worked with SQLite in Python using Pandas.

## Quick Overview

This case study looks at how a country club operates â€” things like:
- Which facilities make money (and which donâ€™t)
- Member referrals and signups
- How often people use the tennis courts
- Guest vs. member usage
- Monthly usage trends

I used SQL and Python to dig into the data and answer each question step by step.

## Notes

If you're reviewing this:
- Everything should be self-contained and run in Jupyter (no extra setup needed)
- All files are included
- Let me know if you run into any issues

Thanks!
